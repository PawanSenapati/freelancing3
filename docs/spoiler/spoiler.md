##### Simple Example

Use Spoiler to hide long sections of content. Pass `maxHeight` prop to control the point at which content will be
hidden under the spoiler and control to show/hide extra appears. If content height is less than `maxHeight`, spoiler
will just render children.

Props `hideLabel` and `showLabel` are required - they are used as spoiler toggle button label in corresponding state.
